Wish Billionaire class of Repubs would buy major media empires, and level the playing field.

Thanks @elonmusk for leveling the field in Twitter!"

Height of hubris."

A useful idiot
This Twitter deal absolutely needs to be investigated
Spending $44bn to buy a company that could well be bankrupt within a month off settlement is clearly not as an investment
So what is it? Who benefits from üê¶ being shut down? https://t.co/6GxRc8GXoq"

homlessgoomba7,2022-11-10 21:45:53+00:00,0,Twitter for iPhone,i genuinely think it‚Äôs funny that elon musk was afraid of losing money if he let twitter sue him so he ended up choosing to buy twitter and lost even more money. can he please sell it back now? i think the joke is getting stale
